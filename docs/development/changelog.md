## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- First SoRoMoX package release published to PyPI.
- `ArticulatedSoftRobot` spatial serial-chain system with optional joint
  stiffness and damping, dense matrix dynamics, ABA forward dynamics, examples,
  documentation, and benchmark coverage.
- Geometric Variable-Strain (GVS), tendon-actuated GVS, I-SUPPORT, and
  McKibben-actuated UMArm models.
- Model-based control, system-identification, residual-learning, reinforcement
  learning, rendering, and CPU/GPU benchmarking examples.
- Open3D and Viser renderers with trajectory, actuator, and video support.

### Changed

- Generalized continuum actuation around composable threadlike actuation models.
- Standardized system, geometry, Lie algebra, operational-space, actuation-space,
  parameter, and base-pose APIs.
- Added support for Python 3.14 and migrated the documentation build to Zensical.
- Expanded the software authorship and citation metadata.

### Fixed

- Corrected dynamics, Jacobian, rendering, control, rollout, and multi-segment
  I-SUPPORT behavior across the supported systems.
