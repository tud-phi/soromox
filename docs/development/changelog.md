## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

- Made the SoRoMoX arXiv preprint the primary academic citation, centralized
  citation guidance, and retained an exact-release software citation for
  reproducibility-sensitive work.

### Fixed

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Section-scoped `paper_results/` workflows that colocate generation and
  plotting code, source or generated data, canonical figures and videos, and
  reproduction instructions for the results reported in the paper.
- Reproducible PCS configuration- and operational-space control case studies
  with shared simulation, plotting, serialization, Viser, phase-separated RMSE,
  and canonical paper-figure workflows.
- A shared Matplotlib publication style and case-specific figure composers for
  consistent typography, sizing, colors, labels, grids, and legends.
- Focused Section Vc tests for case-relative paths, NPZ schemas, overwrite
  protection, plotting, controller setup, trajectory primitives, and rendering.
- Complete Section IVa, IVb, Va, Vd, Ve, and Vf generation workflows alongside
  their paper data and outputs, including released RL checkpoints.
- Reproducible Section Vc evaluation metrics for all six configuration
  coordinates and geometric operational-space pose tracking, with canonical
  NPZ and JSON artifacts and a human- or machine-readable reporting CLI.
- A publication-sized Section Vc composite figure combining configuration-space
  comparisons, operational-space tracking and errors, and chronological
  experiment snapshots in committed PDF and SVG outputs.

### Changed

- Separated lightweight demonstrations under `examples/` from complete
  publication reproduction workflows and datasets under `paper_results/`.
- Made generated example figures and videos topic-local instead of writing them
  to the repository root, and organized paper sections into independent
  `code/`, `data/`, and `outputs/` ownership.
- Made affected example and paper entry points independent of the current
  working directory, added configurable artifact paths and overwrite guards,
  and migrated visualization workflows to the current renderer APIs.
- Standardized the Section Vc paper figures around full-width
  configuration-space tracking and partial-feedback-linearization
  operational-space tracking, with explicit strain labels and prominent
  reference trajectories.
- Store trained model checkpoints through Git LFS while leaving generated
  example artifacts and noncanonical paper diagnostics ignored.
- Made the built-in `tanh` PID integral-error saturation unit preserving as
  `Gamma^-1 tanh(Gamma e)`, retained unit slope at the origin, and validated
  scalar, vector, and matrix saturation parameters against their required
  positivity and shape constraints.
- Applied separate physical integral-error saturation scales to rotational and
  linear Section Vc strains, regenerated the canonical data and figures, and
  added steady-state regulation MAE over the final 10% of each evaluated
  setpoint interval.
- Refactored Viser sequence rendering around deterministic scene and frame
  hooks, synchronized video and lossless snapshot capture, explicit snapshot
  validation, and a render-only workflow for the operational-space paper scene.

### Fixed

- Rejected paused or looping playback modes for finite Viser video exports.
- Included `cbfpy` in the test dependency set so the Section Ve rendering tests
  collect across every supported Python version.
- Corrected the documented Section Vc steady-state evaluation window from the
  final quarter to the final 10% (0.3 s) of each 3 s setpoint interval.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- First SoRoMoX package release published to PyPI.
- `ArticulatedSoftRobot` spatial serial-chain system with optional joint
  stiffness and damping, dense matrix dynamics, ABA forward dynamics, examples,
  documentation, and benchmark coverage.
- Geometric Variable-Strain (GVS), tendon-actuated GVS, I-SUPPORT, and
  McKibben-actuated UMArm models.
- Model-based control, system-identification, residual-learning, reinforcement
  learning, rendering, and CPU/GPU benchmarking examples.
- Open3D and Viser renderers with trajectory, actuator, and video support.

### Changed

- Generalized continuum actuation around composable threadlike actuation models.
- Standardized system, geometry, Lie algebra, operational-space, actuation-space,
  parameter, and base-pose APIs.
- Declared support for Python 3.11 through 3.14 and migrated the documentation
  build to Zensical.
- Set JAX 0.10.0 and Diffrax 0.7.2 as the minimum numerical dependency
  versions validated by CI.
- Expanded the software authorship and citation metadata.

### Fixed

- Corrected dynamics, Jacobian, rendering, control, rollout, and multi-segment
  I-SUPPORT behavior across the supported systems.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-01
